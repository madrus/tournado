# Generate Pull Request Description

You will analyze the git changes between two branches and generate a PR description.

## Branch Selection and Flags

Arguments provided: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the arguments as follows:

- Check if `--verbose` or `-v` flag is present in the arguments
- Remove `--verbose` or `-v` from arguments before parsing branches
- If remaining arguments are empty: compare current branch to `dev`
- If one branch provided: compare that branch to `dev`
- If two branches provided: compare first branch (head/compare) to second branch (base)

**Output Format:**

- **Default (concise)**: Brief summary with key changes only
- **Verbose mode (--verbose or -v flag)**: Detailed description with full sections

## Steps to Execute

1. **Determine branches**:
   - Get current branch with `git branch --show-current`
   - Parse arguments to determine compare branch (head) and base branch
   - Validate both branches exist using `git rev-parse --verify <branch>`

2. **Validate branch relationship**:
   - Check if the branches have a common ancestor: `git merge-base compare base`
   - If no common ancestor found, inform the user: "‚ùå Error: Branches `compare` and `base` do not share a common history. Please verify the branch names."
   - Check if there are any commits to compare: `git log base..compare --oneline`
   - If no commits found, inform the user: "‚ùå Error: No commits found from `base` to `compare`. The branches may be the same or `compare` may be behind `base`."

3. **Ask for confirmation**:
   - Display: "You are going to create a PR from **`compare`** to **`base`**. Continue? (y/n)"
   - Wait for user response
   - If user says yes/y or responds affirmatively: proceed
   - If user says no/n/cancel: ask "Please provide the correct branch names in the format: /pr-desc compare base" and stop
   - Only proceed after receiving confirmation

4. **Gather git information**:
   - Run `git log base..compare --pretty=format:"%h - %s (%an, %ar)" --no-merges` to get commit history
   - Run `git diff base...compare --stat` to get file change statistics
   - Run `git diff base...compare` to get the actual diff (use selectively if too large)

5. **Analyze the changes**:
   - Review commit messages to understand the intent
   - Analyze file stats to understand scope
   - Identify the type of changes (feature, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)
   - Note any breaking changes, database migrations, or deployment notes
   - Determine the most appropriate conventional commit type prefix based on the dominant change type

6. **Generate PR title**:
   - Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`
   - Format: `prefix: description starting with lowercase letter`
   - Example: `feat: add user management workflows and competition group system`
   - The prefix should reflect the most significant or dominant change in the PR
   - If multiple major features, use the most impactful one or use `feat` for feature additions

7. **Generate PR description**:

### Default Format (Concise)

Use this format by default (unless --verbose or -v flag is present):

```markdown
## Summary

[1-2 sentence overview of what this PR does]

## Key Changes

- [3-6 bullet points of main changes]
- [Focus on high-level features/fixes, not implementation details]

## Database Changes (if applicable)

[Brief note about migrations or schema changes, including command to run]

```

### Verbose Format (--verbose or -v flag)

Use this detailed format only when either --verbose or -v flag is present:

```markdown
## Summary

[1-2 sentence overview of what this PR does]

## Changes

- [Bullet point list of key changes]
- [Include both what changed and why if evident from commits]

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] Performance improvement
- [ ] Test coverage

## Testing

[Describe what testing was done or should be done]

## Additional Notes

[Any deployment notes, migration steps, or other important information]

8. **Output the results**:
   - First display the PR title with a clear label: "**PR Title:**"
   - Then display the generated markdown description with a label: "**PR Description:**"
   - If concise format was used, add a note: "üí° Use `--verbose` or `-v` flag for a detailed description"
   - Inform user they can copy both the title and description to GitHub's PR creation page

## Important Notes

- **Default (concise)**: 3-6 key bullet points focusing on high-level changes only
- **Verbose**: Detailed breakdown with all sections including Type of Change checklist and Testing details
- Always highlight breaking changes or database migrations prominently
- For large diffs, focus on commit messages and file stats rather than analyzing every line of code
- Maintain a professional, clear tone suitable for team collaboration
