## ✅ General Coding Style

- TypeScript: prefer inferred types unless required by eslint; no semicolons; single quotes
- React: use function declarations, not expressions
- Tailwind: utility-first, grouped classes; avoid hardcoded px values

---

## 🧠 Cursor Guidance

- Always enable `context7` when modifying non-trivial code
- For anything that touches multiple files, use `sequentialThinking` to plan steps
- When resolving stack traces, use `explainTrace` before `autoFix`
- Review diffs manually after using `fixErrors` or `autoFix` — don't blindly trust green tests
- Only use `smartCommit` after verifying file renames, deletions, and semantic scope

---

## 🎨 Tailwind Rules

- Group classes in this order: layout → spacing → color → typography → effects
- Avoid `w-[123px]`, `h-[58px]`, etc. unless absolutely needed
- Prefer Tailwind’s spacing scale (e.g. `px-4`) to manual values
- Use translucency and backdrop filters for UI polish, not raw RGBA

---

## 🧭 Routing (React Router v7)

- Routes must be declarative and colocated with their layout when possible
- Use `useNavigate` and `useParams` from react-router@7 — never `useHistory`
- Always update the parent `routes.tsx` manually when adding a new route
- Prefer lazy-loaded routes unless performance deems otherwise

---

## ⚒️ Refactoring Philosophy

- **Minimal change principle**: Refactor with the least number of modified lines
- Don’t apply formatting or stylistic cleanups unless explicitly requested
- Use `refactor` MCP only when scoped to one file or with `context7` for connected modules
- Avoid renaming public API (functions/props) unless you also update all usages

---

## 📦 Zustand & State

- Never mutate state directly — always use the setter
- Zustand slices should be flat; use selectors for derived state
- Don’t nest Zustand stores — prefer small slices per concern
- Extract actions into `actions.ts` if they grow beyond 3–5 functions

---

## 🔌 Tanstack Query

- Use tuple-style keys: `['project', id]` not string-based keys
- Always colocate query/mutation function with the hook that uses it
- Favor suspense + error boundaries instead of conditional `isLoading` logic

---

## 🧪 Testing (Vitest / Playwright)

- Describe real user behavior in Playwright (`click login`, `assert dashboard appears`)
- For Vitest, smoke test all Zustand mutations and selectors minimally
- Use MSW when mocking API responses — not custom fetch mocks
