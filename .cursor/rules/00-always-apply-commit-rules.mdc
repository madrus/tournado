# Always Apply Conventional Commits

**CRITICAL:** All commit messages **must** use the [Conventional Commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org) format.

## Commit Message Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- **Type:** The kind of change (see below)
- **Scope:** The area of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `api`)
- **Description:** Short, imperative summary (max 72 characters, no period)

## Commit Types

**Primary Types:**
- `feat:` – New feature
- `fix:` – Bug fix
- `refactor:` – Code refactoring (not a fix or feature)
- `docs:` – Documentation only
- `style:` – Formatting/styling (no code meaning change)
- `test:` – Tests (add/correct)
- `chore:` – Maintenance, build process, auxiliary tools

**Secondary Types:**
- `ci:` – CI/CD config/scripts
- `build:` – Build system or external dependencies
- `perf:` – Performance improvement
- `revert:` – Revert a previous commit

## Scope Guidelines

Use a relevant, lowercase scope:
- `auth`, `ui`, `api`, `db`, `config`, `deps`, `types`, `i18n`, `routes`, etc.

## Commit Message Rules

- Use lowercase for type and scope
- No period at the end of the description
- Use imperative mood ("add", not "added" or "adds")
- Use present tense
- Description under 72 characters

### Breaking Changes

- Add `!` after type/scope: `feat!:` or `feat(api)!:`
- Include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer explaining the change and migration path

### Description Guidelines

- Start with a verb (add, fix, update, remove, refactor, etc.)
- Be specific and clear
- Focus on what changed (use body for why, if needed)

## Examples

**Good:**
```text
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login functionality
fix(ui): resolve button alignment on mobile devices
refactor(api): simplify user validation logic
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(components): format code according to prettier rules
test(auth): add unit tests for login validation
chore(deps): update React to version 18.2.0
ci(github): add automated deployment workflow
build(docker): optimize container build process
perf(db): improve query performance with indexes
```

**Bad:**
```text
❌ Updated some files
❌ Fix bug
❌ refactor: Fixed the issue with the authentication system that was causing problems
❌ feat: adds new feature
❌ WIP: working on authentication
❌ Fixed authentication bug.
❌ FEAT: ADD NEW COMPONENT
```

**Breaking Change Example:**
```text
feat(api)!: change user authentication endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: The /auth endpoint now requires a different request format.
Migration: Update client code to use { email, password } instead of { username, password }
```

**Multi-line Example:**
```text
feat(tournament): add bracket generation algorithm

Implement Swiss tournament bracket generation with automatic pairing
based on player ratings and previous match history. Supports up to
64 players with configurable round robin options.

Closes #123
```

## Commit Message Generation Guidelines

1. Analyze the changes to determine the most appropriate type
2. Identify the scope based on files changed
3. Summarize the change in imperative mood
4. Keep it concise but descriptive
5. Use consistent language and terminology

**Change Mapping:**
- New files/features → `feat:`
- Bug fixes → `fix:`
- Code reorganization → `refactor:`
- Documentation updates → `docs:`
- Test additions → `test:`
- Dependency changes → `chore(deps):`
- Configuration changes → `chore(config):`
- UI/styling changes → `style:` or `feat(ui):`

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing any commit message:
- [ ] Starts with conventional commit type
- [ ] Uses lowercase for type and scope
- [ ] Description is imperative mood
- [ ] Description is under 72 characters
- [ ] No period at end of description
- [ ] Scope is relevant to changes made
- [ ] Breaking changes are properly marked

## Tooling Integration

These rules are enforced by:
- Git hooks (e.g., Husky)
- Commitizen
- Conventional Changelog
- Semantic Release
- GitHub/GitLab commit message validation
