# Project Overview - Tournado

**Tournado** is a comprehensive tournament management system built with React Router v7, designed to streamline soccer tournament operations from team registration through live match tracking and public results viewing.

## 🏆 Project Purpose
A modern, mobile-first PWA that serves multiple user roles:
- **Public Users**: Team registration and tournament viewing
- **Admins**: Complete tournament and team management
- **Referees**: Score entry and match management
- **Tournament Managers**: Tournament-specific administration

## 🏗️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Router v7 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (mobile-first approach)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite
- **Authentication**: Session-based with role-based access control
- **Internationalization**: i18next (Dutch, English, French, Arabic, Turkish)
- **Testing**: Playwright (E2E) + Vitest (Unit)
- **PWA**: Service Worker with offline capabilities

## 📁 Core Architecture

### Main Entry Points
- `app/root.tsx` - Root component with theme and i18n providers
- `app/entry.client.tsx` - Client-side hydration and PWA registration
- `app/entry.server.tsx` - Server-side rendering entry point

### Key Directories
- `app/routes/` - Route-based file structure with nested layouts
- `app/components/` - Reusable React components (buttons, inputs, navigation)
- `app/stores/` - Zustand state management for forms and auth
- `app/models/` - Database models and business logic
- `app/i18n/` - Multi-language translation files and configuration
- `app/utils/` - Utility functions, validation, and helpers
- `app/styles/` - Tailwind CSS and custom styles
- `app/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for common functionality
- `prisma/` - Database schema, migrations, and seed data
- `playwright/` - End-to-end tests and test utilities

### Database Models (Prisma)
- **User**: Authentication and role management
- **Tournament**: Tournament details, categories, divisions
- **Team**: Team registration and management
- **Pool**: Tournament pool organization
- **Match**: Match scheduling and results
- **Score**: Match scoring system

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Principles
- **Mobile-First**: All layouts prioritize mobile experience
- **Responsive**: Desktop enhancements using `lg:` breakpoint
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline functionality and installability
- **Multi-Language**: RTL support for Arabic, LTR for Dutch, English, French, Turkish

## 🔧 Configuration Files
- `react-router-config.ts` - React Router configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite build configuration and plugins
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema definition
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - E2E test configuration

## 🚀 Development Workflow
- **Development**: `pnpm dev` - Hot reload development server
- **Database**: `pnpm db:reset` - Reset and seed database
- **Testing**: `pnpm test` - Run Vitest unit tests
- **E2E Testing**: `pnpm test:e2e` - Run Playwright tests
- **Build**: `pnpm build` - Production build
- **Deployment**: Fly.io with Docker containerization
