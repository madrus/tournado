# Database Schema

The application uses Prisma with SQLite as the database provider. The schema is defined in [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma).

## Models

### User
The central model representing application users:
- Has one optional Password record
- Can have multiple Teams
- Tracked with creation and update timestamps

### Password
Stores hashed user passwords:
- One-to-one relationship with User
- Cascade deletion with user

### Team
Represents user teams:
- Belongs to a User
- Contains teamName and teamClass
- Tracked with creation and update timestamps

## Database Management
- Database migrations are stored in `prisma/migrations/`
- Seeding data can be found in [prisma/seed.ts](mdc:prisma/seed.ts)
- Database operations are handled through [app/db.server.ts](mdc:app/db.server.ts)

## Updating the Schema

When making changes to the database schema:

1. Edit [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma)
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   pnpm prisma generate    # Update Prisma Client
   pnpm prisma migrate dev # Create and apply migration
   ```
3. Update this rule file to reflect the new schema
4. If the changes affect database operations, update [app/db.server.ts](mdc:app/db.server.ts)
5. Update any affected tests
6. Update the seed file [prisma/seed.ts](mdc:prisma/seed.ts) if necessary

Remember to commit both the schema changes and the updated rules together to keep documentation in sync with the code.
