# Testing Guide

The application uses multiple testing approaches defined in various configuration files:
- [vitest.config.ts](mdc:vitest.config.ts) - Unit and integration tests
- [cypress.config.ts](mdc:cypress.config.ts) - End-to-end tests

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Located next to the files they test with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension
- Use Vitest as the test runner
- Testing utilities available in [app/utils.test.ts](mdc:app/utils.test.ts)

### End-to-End Tests
- Located in the `cypress/` directory
- Use Cypress with Testing Library
- Run against a live development or production build

## Mocking
- Mock service worker (MSW) configurations in `mocks/` directory
- Can run the application with mocks using `pnpm run start:mocks`

## CI/CD Testing
- All tests are run as part of the validation script: `pnpm run validate`
- Includes:
  - Unit tests
  - Type checking
  - Linting
  - E2E tests
