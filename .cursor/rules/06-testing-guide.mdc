# Testing Guide

The application uses multiple testing approaches defined in various configuration files:
- [vitest.config.ts](mdc:vitest.config.ts) - Unit and integration tests
- [playwright.config.ts](mdc:playwright.config.ts) - End-to-end tests

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Located in a `__tests__` subfolder next to the files they test, with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension
- Use Vitest as the test runner
- Testing utilities available in [app/utils.test.ts](mdc:app/utils.test.ts)
- **Rule:** All new unit test files must be placed in a `__tests__` subfolder adjacent to the code they test. This ensures a clean codebase and makes it easy to find related tests.

### End-to-End Tests
- Located in the `playwright/` directory
- Use Playwright with Testing Library
- Run against a live development or production build
