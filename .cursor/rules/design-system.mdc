# Design System Guidelines

## UI Patterns

### Actionable Panels
- Use actionable panels with clear CTAs for user interactions across all features where users need to take actions
- Panel types: info, action, warning, success
- Always include clear next steps or primary actions
- Maintain consistent spacing and visual hierarchy

### Background Gradients
- Apply consistent background gradients across all pages using Tailwind classes
- Use established gradient patterns for visual consistency
- Ensure gradients work in both light and dark modes

## Color System

### Semantic Colors
- Always use semantic color classes from `app/styles/tailwind.css` for ColorAccent types
- Maintain color consistency across components
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA standard)

## Component Standards

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44px touch targets for all actionable elements
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Mobile-first approach with `lg:` enhancements for desktop

### Loading States
- Consistent loading indicators and skeleton screens
- Provide feedback for all async operations
- Use established loading component patterns

### Error Handling
- Consistent error messaging patterns
- Clear recovery actions for users
- Sanitized error messages for public routes

## Layout Principles

### Mobile-First Design
- Default to mobile layout
- Enhance with `lg:` prefixes for desktop
- Responsive spacing and typography scales
- Touch-optimized navigation and interactions
