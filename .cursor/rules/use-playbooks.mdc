# AI Workflow Guidance

When you need to understand project standards, coding patterns, or framework-specific best practices, you MUST use the tools provided by the `cursor-rules-mcp` MCP server.

Your workflow should be:
1.  Use `searchRules` with a relevant query (e.g., "react hooks", "python error handling") to find appropriate rules.
2.  From the search results, identify the most relevant rule.
3.  Use `getRule` with the slug of the chosen rule to fetch its content.
4.  Apply the fetched rule to the current task. Do NOT guess or use outdated knowledge.
