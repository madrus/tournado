# INSTRUCTIONS — READ THIS FIRST WHEN CREATING NEW TASKS

This file is a single, self-contained TASK for an AI agent. **One task = one file.**
Follow the steps below when creating new tasks.

1. **Name your file**: place under `.cursor/tasks/` using the task ID as prefix followed by kebab-case description, e.g., `tasks/TASK-0123-add-tournament-bracket.mdc`.
2. **Fill the frontmatter** (above) completely. All metadata should be in the YAML frontmatter section.
3. **Dependency validation**: Before starting any task, check that all dependencies have `status: "done"`. If not, present user with three options:
   - **[1] Stop** - I need to complete dependencies first
   - **[2] Continue anyway** - I know these are ready despite status
   - **[3] Cancel** - Let me choose a different task
4. **Use information-dense keywords** throughout (exact file paths, function signatures, type names, constants, route patterns).
5. **Define types first** if adding new data structures. Reference those types by exact name in later steps.
6. **Order your steps** so later steps explicitly reference earlier artifacts by name (files, types, functions, routes).
7. **Keep scope tight**: this task should be completable independently. If it's large, split into multiple task files and add them to `dependencies`.
8. **Acceptance criteria** must be testable and unambiguous. Include file paths for tests and example route/API usage.
9. **Context plan** must list the files to add to the model's context at the start (mark dep files read-only) and which files must exist at the end.
10. **Testing strategy** use primarily integration tests with Vitest and E2E tests with Playwright using Page Object Model. Include database seeding for tests.
11. **TypeScript conventions**: Follow TypeScript conventions from the dedicated section below.
12. **File creation safety**: Before creating any new file, check if a file with that name already exists. If it exists, analyze its content to determine: (a) if it's the same file that needs minor updates/enhancements, (b) if it's a completely different file with different structure/purpose. For case (a), update/merge carefully preserving existing functionality. For case (b), ask the user for guidance on how to proceed. Never overwrite existing code without analysis and consideration.

## ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORDS

Choose your task pattern based on the scope and reusability of the work:

### 🌍 **SHARED Task** - Updates shared/global code

**When to use**: Updating reusable components, core utilities, global stores, database models
**File locations**:
- `app/components/` - Reusable UI components across features
- `app/utils/` - Cross-cutting utilities (session, validation, etc.)
- `app/lib/` - Core business logic and shared libraries
- `app/models/` - Database access layer (shared across features)
- `app/stores/` - **Global stores only** (cross-feature state management)

### 🎯 **FEATURE Task** - Self-contained business domain

**When to use**: Distinct business domain with its own data models, business rules, workflows
**File locations**:
- `app/features/[feature]/` - All feature-specific code
- `app/features/[feature]/stores/` - **Feature-specific stores** (co-located)
- `app/features/[feature]/components/` - Feature-internal components
- `app/features/[feature]/utils.ts` - Feature-specific utilities
- `app/features/[feature]/types.ts` - Feature-specific types

### 🔗 **HYBRID Task** - Mix of shared and feature-specific work

**When to use**: Feature work that also requires updates to shared components/utilities
**File locations**: Mix of both patterns with clear rationale for each

### 📦 **MIGRATION Task** - Refactoring existing code into feature structure

**When to use**: Moving scattered code into a cohesive feature module
**Special considerations**: Maintain backward compatibility, update all imports

### 🧭 **Decision Criteria**

- **Shared**: Used by multiple features OR core infrastructure
- **Feature**: Belongs to single business domain AND could be extracted as separate service
- **Store placement**: Global = cross-feature state, Feature = domain-specific state
- **Component placement**: Shared = reusable UI, Feature = domain-specific components

# 1) High-Level Objective

<One sentence that describes the user-facing end state. Avoid technical jargon.>

# 2) Background / Context (Optional but recommended)

<Short rationale or business context for why this task exists. Link any tickets/PRDs.>

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- ASSUMPTION: <If any info is missing, state the pragmatic assumption here.>
- Constraint: <e.g., "Use only dependencies listed in package.json".>
- Constraint: <e.g., "Follow existing CVA patterns for component styling".>
- Constraint: <e.g., "Use Prisma for all database operations".>
- Constraint: <e.g., "Maintain compatibility with existing tournament data structure".>

# 4) Dependencies (Other Tasks or Artifacts)

- .cursor/tasks/<other-task-file>.mdc
- prisma/schema.prisma _(required existing schema)_
- app/lib/lib.types.ts _(existing types)_

# 5) Context Plan

> Choose the appropriate pattern based on your Architecture Decision from above

## 🌍 SHARED Task Pattern

**Beginning (add to model context):**
- app/components/<ExistingComponent>/ _(read-only)_
- app/utils/<existingUtil>.server.ts _(read-only)_
- app/lib/lib.types.ts _(read-only)_
- prisma/schema.prisma _(read-only)_

**End state (files that will be created/modified):**
> List only the specific files your task will create or modify. Common examples:
- app/components/<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.tsx _(if creating shared component)_
- app/utils/<utilName>.server.ts _(if adding shared utility)_
- app/stores/<storeName>.ts _(if adding global state)_
- app/routes/<route>.tsx _(if adding/modifying routes)_

## 🎯 FEATURE Task Pattern

**Beginning (add to model context):**
- app/features/<feature>/types.ts _(read-only if exists)_
- app/models/<resource>.server.ts _(read-only)_
- prisma/schema.prisma _(read-only)_

**End state (files that will be created/modified):**
> List only what this specific task will create. Feature structure is flexible:
- app/features/<feature>/index.ts _(feature public API)_
- app/features/<feature>/<specific-files-for-this-task>
- app/features/<feature>/__tests__/ _(test files as needed)_

> Common feature files (create only if needed for your task):
> - components/<Component>/ _(feature-specific UI)_
> - stores/<store>.ts _(feature-specific state)_
> - utils.ts _(feature utilities)_
> - types.ts _(feature types)_

## 🔗 HYBRID Task Pattern

**Beginning (add to model context):**
- app/components/<SharedComponent>/ _(read-only)_
- app/features/<feature>/ _(read-only if exists)_
- app/lib/lib.types.ts _(read-only)_

**End state (files that will be created/modified):**
> Mix of shared and feature files - list only what this task actually needs:
- app/components/<SharedComponent>/ _(if updating shared component)_
- app/features/<feature>/<specific-files> _(if creating feature-specific code)_

## 📦 MIGRATION Task Pattern

**Beginning (add to model context):**
- app/<scattered-files>/ _(files to be migrated)_
- app/components/<related-components>/ _(read-only)_
- All files importing the scattered functionality

**End state (files that will be created/modified):**
> Migration creates new structure and updates existing dependencies:
- app/features/<feature>/ _(new feature structure)_
- All files that import the migrated functionality _(updated imports)_
- Old scattered files _(removed after migration)_

# 6) Low-Level Steps (Ordered, information-dense)

> Write concrete, atomic steps specific to your task. Include **file paths, exact names, signatures, params with defaults, return types**.
> Use the patterns below as reference, but create only what your task actually needs.

## File Naming Conventions

**Server-only files** (`.server.ts`):
- Cannot be imported by client-side code
- Use for database operations, authentication, server-side utilities
- Examples: `session.server.ts`, `auth.server.ts`, `user.server.ts`

**Universal files** (`.ts`):
- Can be imported by both client and server
- Use for types, pure functions, utilities that work everywhere
- Examples: `types.ts`, `utils.ts`, `constants.ts`

**Client-focused files** (`.tsx`, `.ts` in stores/):
- Primarily used by client-side code
- Examples: components, stores, client-side utilities

## TypeScript Conventions

All code must follow these TypeScript conventions:

1. **Use `type` instead of `interface`**: Unless interfaces are required for extending
2. **No semicolons**: All code snippets must be TypeScript without semicolons
3. **No `any` type**: Always use strong typing instead of `any`
4. **Return types**: All functions must have explicit return types
5. **Arrow functions**: If a function only returns something (single expression), use arrow function syntax
6. **Semantic variable names**: Avoid generic identifiers like `data`, `info`, `result`, `callback`, `handler` - use descriptive names that indicate the content (e.g., `userData`, `teamInfo`, `validationResult`, `onSubmit`, `onUserSelect`). Exception: when variable comes from third-party libraries
7. **Callback naming**: Use descriptive callback names with `on` prefix (e.g., `onSubmit`, `onUserSelect`, `onTeamCreate`) rather than generic names like `callback` or `handler`
8. **Props objects**: Functions with parameter objects should follow this pattern:
   - Create a type named `<FunctionName>Props` for the parameters
   - Type the props parameter as `Readonly<FunctionNameProps>`
   - Use object destructuring in the function signature
9. **Module Import Patterns**: 
   - Use named imports for ESM modules: `import { function } from 'module'`
   - Use default imports for CommonJS modules: `import pkg from 'commonjs-module'`  
   - Firebase Admin SDK: Use `import admin from 'firebase-admin'` for main module access (e.g., `admin.credential.cert()`), submodule imports like `firebase-admin/app` and `firebase-admin/auth` are fine as named imports
   - When unsure, check if error mentions "CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports"

Example:

```ts
type CreateSessionFromFirebaseTokenProps = {
  idToken: string
  request: Request
}

export const createSessionFromFirebaseToken = async (
  props: Readonly<CreateSessionFromFirebaseTokenProps>
): Promise<SessionBridgeResult | null> => {
  const { idToken, request } = props
  // function body
}
```

## Step Guidelines by Architecture Pattern

### 🌍 SHARED Task - Common step types:

- **Shared components**: `app/components/<Name>/` - reusable across features (client + SSR)
- **Server-only utilities**: `app/utils/<name>.server.ts` - server-side functions (database, auth, etc.)
- **Universal utilities**: `app/lib/<name>.ts` - functions usable by both client and server
- **Global stores**: `app/stores/<name>.ts` - cross-feature state management (client-side)
- **Database models**: `app/models/<resource>.server.ts` - data access layer (server-only)
- **Routes**: `app/routes/<route>.tsx` - application pages/endpoints (SSR + client)

### 🎯 FEATURE Task - Common step types:

- **Feature structure**: `app/features/<feature>/index.ts` - public API exports (universal)
- **Feature components**: `app/features/<feature>/components/<Name>/` - domain-specific UI (client + SSR)
- **Feature stores**: `app/features/<feature>/stores/<name>.ts` - domain-specific state (client-side)
- **Feature utilities**: `app/features/<feature>/utils.ts` - feature-specific helpers (universal)
- **Feature server utilities**: `app/features/<feature>/server.ts` - server-only functions (if needed)
- **Feature types**: `app/features/<feature>/types.ts` - domain-specific types (universal)

### 🔗 HYBRID Task - Mix as needed:

- Combine shared and feature patterns based on requirements
- Update shared components for reusability
- Create feature-specific implementations
- Maintain clear boundaries between shared and feature code

### 📦 MIGRATION Task - Common step types:

- **Analysis**: Map existing scattered files and dependencies
- **Feature structure**: Create new organized feature directory
- **File migration**: Move and refactor existing code
- **Import updates**: Update all dependent files to use new structure
- **Cleanup**: Remove old scattered files after successful migration

## Example Step Structure

**Write your specific steps here.** For example:

1. **Create [specific thing needed for your task]**
   - File: `[exact path]`
   - Exported API: `[exact function signatures]`
   - Details: [what it does, how it integrates]

2. **Update [specific existing file]**
   - File: `[exact path]`
   - Changes: [what gets modified]
   - Preserve: [what stays the same]

3. **Add tests**
   - Files: `[exact test file paths]`
   - Cases: [specific test scenarios]

## Additional Common Steps (use as needed)

**Component Variants** (for any UI component):
- File: `<component-path>/<componentName>.variants.ts`
- Use CVA pattern for consistent styling

**Routes** (if task involves routing):
- File: `app/routes/<resource>.<action>.tsx`
- Add loaders/actions as needed

**Database Models** (if task involves data operations):
- File: `app/models/<resource>.server.ts`
- Add functions for data operations

**Tests** (required for all tasks):
- Unit tests: `<component-path>/__tests__/<ComponentName>.test.tsx` (Vitest)
- E2E tests: `playwright/tests/<featureName>.spec.ts` (Playwright with Page Object Model)
- Test cases should focus on user-facing behavior, not implementation details

# 7) Types & Interfaces (if applicable)

> Define or reference types here so the model has a stable contract. Use `type` instead of `interface` unless extending is required.
> Choose location based on your Architecture Decision.

## 🌍 Shared Types (reusable across features)

```ts
// app/lib/lib.types.ts
export type <SharedDataType> = {
  id: string
  name: string
  status: <StatusEnum>
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## 🎯 Feature Types (domain-specific)

```ts
// app/features/<feature>/types.ts
export type <FeatureDataType> = {
  id: string
  featureSpecificField: string
  // Can extend shared types if needed
} & SharedDataType

export type <FeatureComponentProps> = {
  data: <FeatureDataType>[]
  onAction?: (item: <FeatureDataType>) => void
  className?: string
}
```

## 🔗 Hybrid Types (mix of both)

- Shared types in `app/lib/lib.types.ts`
- Feature-specific extensions in `app/features/<feature>/types.ts`
- Import shared types into feature types as needed

# 8) Acceptance Criteria

> Write specific, testable criteria based on your Architecture Decision and end state files.

## Common Criteria (all tasks)

- All files listed in "End state" section exist and export expected APIs
- **Validation passes**: Run `pnpm validate` and fix all errors before completion
- All unit tests pass locally with `pnpm test:run`
- All E2E tests pass locally with `pnpm test:e2e:run`
- New strings added to all locales in `app/i18n/locales`; English uses title case, all other languages use sentence case following their respective grammar rules

**Testing Workflow**: Follow this cycle strictly:
1. **Validation first** (`pnpm validate`) - must pass before proceeding
2. **Unit tests** (`pnpm test:run`) - if fixes needed, return to step 1
3. **E2E tests** (`pnpm test:e2e:run`) - if fixes needed, return to step 1, then step 2
4. Any code changes require restarting from step 1

## Architecture-Specific Criteria

### 🌍 Shared Task Criteria

- Components are reusable and don't contain feature-specific logic
- Shared utilities can be imported by multiple features
- Global stores manage cross-feature state appropriately
- No breaking changes to existing feature imports

### 🎯 Feature Task Criteria

- Feature exports clean public API via `app/features/<feature>/index.ts`
- Feature components use shared components as building blocks
- Feature-specific stores manage domain state appropriately
- Feature can be developed/tested independently

### 🔗 Hybrid Task Criteria

- Shared components maintain backward compatibility
- Feature-specific components integrate properly with shared components
- Clear separation between shared and feature-specific concerns

### 📦 Migration Task Criteria

- All external imports updated to use new feature structure
- No breaking changes to public APIs during migration
- Old scattered files successfully removed after migration
- Feature boundary is clearly defined and cohesive

# 9) Testing Strategy

## Common Testing Approach (all tasks)

- Create unit tests with Vitest that verify component behavior and rendering
- Create E2E tests with Playwright using Page Object Model pattern
- Include database seeding for realistic test data
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test accessibility with screen reader navigation
- Avoid testing implementation details - focus on user-facing behavior
- **Mock patterns**: When mocking CommonJS modules (like Firebase Admin), ensure mock structure matches import pattern (e.g., `{ default: { ... } }` for default imports)

## Architecture-Specific Testing

### 🌍 Shared Task Testing

- Test component reusability across different contexts
- Mock external dependencies to ensure pure functionality
- Verify global stores don't leak state between tests

### 🎯 Feature Task Testing

- Test feature in isolation with minimal external dependencies
- Use feature's public API for integration tests
- Mock shared dependencies consistently

### 🔗 Hybrid Task Testing

- Test both shared and feature-specific functionality
- Verify integration between shared and feature components
- Test backward compatibility when updating shared components

### 📦 Migration Task Testing

- Test that all external imports still work after migration
- Verify no functionality was lost during migration
- Test new feature structure works as expected
