# Project Structure and Preferences

## Components Organization

- Shared components are located in `src/components` folder 
- Feature specific components are located inside `src/features/<feature_name>/components` folder for each feature 
- Components follow pascal-cased naming convention, other types of functions follow camel-cased naming convention

## Styling

- Use TailwindCSS for styling and semantic color system

## State Management

- Prefer Zustand for complex state management, especially for forms, to avoid prop drilling
