# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Tournado is a modern tournament management system built with React Router v7, Prisma, SQLite, and TypeScript. It's a full-stack web application with PWA capabilities for managing sports tournaments, teams, and matches.

## Key Technologies & Architecture

- **Framework**: React Router v7 (file-based routing with SSR)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite
- **UI**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS v4
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E) with custom MCP server
- **Build**: Vite with PWA support
- **Deployment**: Fly.io with containerized deployments

## Essential Commands

### Development

```bash
pnpm setup          # Initial setup: generate Prisma client, migrate DB, seed data
pnpm dev            # Start dev server with HMR
pnpm dev:mocks      # Start dev server with MSW mocks enabled
```

### Building & Production

```bash
pnpm build          # Build for production (includes Prisma generation and React Router typegen)
pnpm start          # Start production server
pnpm start:mocks    # Start production server with mocks
```

### Testing

```bash
pnpm test:watch     # Run Vitest in watch mode
pnpm test:run       # Run all unit tests once
pnpm test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage report
pnpm test:e2e       # Run Playwright E2E tests in UI mode
pnpm test:e2e:run   # Run specific E2E test (teams.spec.ts) with HTML reporter
pnpm test:e2e:built # Build and run E2E tests against production build
```

### Code Quality

```bash
pnpm lint           # Format with Prettier + run ESLint
pnpm typecheck      # Run React Router typegen + TypeScript checking
pnpm validate       # Run lint, typecheck, and test:run in parallel
```

### Database Operations

```bash
pnpm prisma:seed    # Seed database with test data
pnpm db:reset:local # Reset local database (destructive)
```

### Documentation

```bash
pnpm docs           # Start Docsify documentation server on port 3030
```

## Architecture Overview

### Route Structure

- **File-based routing**: Routes defined in `app/routes/` with React Router v7
- **Nested layouts**: Uses React Router's nested routing capabilities
- **Protected routes**: Authentication handled via session middleware
- **Route groups**: Organized by feature (auth, teams, admin areas)

### Data Layer

- **Models**: Server-side data access in `app/models/` (user.server.ts, team.server.ts, tournament.server.ts)
- **Database**: Prisma schema defines User, Team, Tournament, Match entities with enums for roles, divisions, categories
- **Loaders/Actions**: React Router loader/action pattern for data fetching and mutations

### Component Architecture

- **Shared components**: Reusable UI components in `app/components/`
- **Feature components**: Organized by domain (teams, navigation, auth, etc.)
- **Form handling**: Custom form components with validation
- **Error boundaries**: Layered error handling with fallback UIs

### State Management

- **Server state**: Handled via React Router loaders/actions
- **Client state**: Zustand stores in `app/stores/`
- **Form state**: Local component state with controlled inputs

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Vitest with React Testing Library (\*.test.ts/tsx files)
- **E2E tests**: Playwright in `playwright/tests/` (\*.spec.ts files)
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage thresholds (70% across all metrics)
- **Test separation**: Clear separation between unit and E2E test files

## Development Patterns

### Import Aliases

- `~/` maps to `app/` directory
- Use `~/components/`, `~/models/`, `~/utils/` for imports

### Authentication

- Firebase Authentication with Google OAuth and Email/Password
- Session cookie bridging for SSR compatibility
- Environment separation (CI/staging/production Firebase projects)
- Role-based access control (ADMIN, MANAGER, REFEREE, PUBLIC)
- Auth state managed via React Router loaders

### Styling Standards

- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Primary styling framework with utility classes
- **CVA (Class Variance Authority)**: Standard for component variants and conditional styling
- **Semantic color classes**: Always use the semantic color classes from `app/styles/tailwind.css` if the colors fall under ColorAccent type
- **Component styling pattern**: Use CVA variants for consistent, maintainable component styling

### Code Quality Rules

- **Avoid direct Node access**. Prefer using the methods from Testing Library
- **Avoid "any" as type**. Always use strong typing
- **No semicolons**. Follow the codebase convention of omitting semicolons in JavaScript/TypeScript code

### Claude Behavior Rules

- **Do NOT run lint or typecheck** unless explicitly requested by the user
- **Do NOT run unit tests** unless explicitly requested by the user
- **You may proactively verify code quality** and tell me about them asking if I want them fixed

### Database Schema

Key entities: User, Team, Tournament, Match with relationships and enums for sports categories, divisions, and match statuses.

### PWA Features

- Service worker with Workbox
- Offline-first caching strategy
- Add-to-homescreen prompts
- Manifest configuration for standalone app experience

## Important Notes

- **Node.js**: Requires Node ≥22 and pnpm ≥10
- **Environment**: Uses .env files for configuration (see .env.example)
- **Database**: SQLite for development, configurable for production
- **Deployment**: Configured for Fly.io with Dockerfile
- **MCP Integration**: Features production-ready Vitest MCP server for AI-assisted testing

## Environment Setup

### Firebase Project Configuration

The application uses 3 Firebase project configurations across 4 contexts:

| Context                 | Firebase Project   | Purpose                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **CI (GitHub Actions)** | `ci-dummy-project` | Dummy values for testing          |
| **Development (Local)** | `tournado-dev`     | Local development                 |
| **Staging**             | `tournado-dev`     | Testing and acceptance deployment |
| **Production**          | `tournado-prod`    | Live application                  |

**Key Point**: Local development and Staging share the same Firebase project (`tournado-dev`) but serve different purposes. They differ in configuration method (`.env` vs Fly.io secrets), DATABASE_URL, and BASE_URL values.

### Automated Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login

# Install GitHub CLI (for secrets management)
brew install gh
gh auth login

# Install Fly CLI (for deployment)
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
fly auth login
```

**Setup Scripts**:

```bash
# Configure CI environment (automated - dummy Firebase values)
chmod +x setup-github-secrets.sh
./setup-github-secrets.sh

# Configure Fly.io environments (run individual commands due to auth/timeout issues)
# Use template as reference: docs/templates/setup-flyio-secrets.sh.template
# See docs/environment-variables.md for complete command-by-command instructions

# For staging (run each command individually in terminal):
fly auth login
flyctl secrets set SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" --app tournado-staging
flyctl secrets set SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS="your-email@domain.com" --app tournado-staging
# ... (continue with other secrets one-by-one via flyctl commands)

# Verify all secrets are configured
fly secrets list --app tournado-staging
```

**Important**: Fly.io script automation can fail due to authentication token expiration and deployment timeouts. Individual command execution is more reliable for Fly.io environments.

**Verification**: Use `fly secrets list --app [app-name]` to verify all 15 expected environment variables are set.

### Local Development Setup

Ensure your `.env` file has the required variables for local development:

**Note**: Local development and Staging deployment share the same Firebase project (`tournado-dev`).

```bash
# Core application
SESSION_SECRET="your-local-session-secret"
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS="your-email@domain.com"

# Firebase Client (shared with Staging deployment)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="[from tournado-dev project]"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="tournado-dev.firebaseapp.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="tournado-dev"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="tournado-dev.firebasestorage.app"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="[from tournado-dev]"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="[from tournado-dev]"
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=""

# Firebase Admin (shared with Staging deployment)
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID="tournado-dev"
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL="[service-account-email]"
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="[service-account-private-key]"

# Local development specific settings
EMAIL_FROM="Local Dev <dev@example.com>"
BASE_URL="http://localhost:5173"
RESEND_API_KEY="[your-resend-key]"  # Optional for local development
```

## Documentation System

### Overview

- **Location**: The `docs/` folder contains comprehensive project documentation
- **Dual Format**: Serves as both an Obsidian Vault and a Docsify documentation site
- **Docsify Setup**: Uses `_sidebar.md` file to define navigation structure for the web interface
- **Access**: Run `pnpm docs` to serve documentation at `http://localhost:3030`

### File Naming Convention

- **Regular content files**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens) for all new files
   - Examples: `daily-template.md`, `project-notes.md`, `meeting-summary.md`
- **System/rule files**: Use ALL CAPS for configuration and rule files
   - Examples: `CLAUDE.md`, `TAGS.md`, `README.md`

### Documentation Navigation Rules

When creating or modifying any content in the docs vault, you MUST:

1. **Update `docs/_sidebar.md`** whenever you create a new .md file in the docs/ directory or subdirectories
2. **Maintain logical organization** in the sidebar - group related files together and use appropriate nesting
3. **Use descriptive titles** in the sidebar that may differ from the filename for better navigation
4. **Test navigation** by running `pnpm docs` to ensure the new file is accessible via Docsify

### Tagging System Rules

When creating or modifying any content in the docs vault, you MUST:

1. **Always reference `TAGS.md`** as the source of truth for the tagging system
2. **Apply appropriate hashtags** to all created content following the rules in `TAGS.md`
3. **Keep `TAGS.md` updated** when introducing new tag categories or rules
4. **Use consistent tagging** across all files to maintain organization and discoverability
5. **Follow file naming conventions** as specified above
6. **Place tags at the bottom** of the document (move existing tags to bottom if there is text below them)
7. **DO NOT add tags to ALL CAPS system files** (these are configuration files and should remain untagged)
