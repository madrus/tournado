# Extra bits & pieces

## ADD Google Auth

- Google Authentication — Allow users to authenticate using their Google accounts via the Firebase SDK.
- Email/Password Authentication — Enable users to register and login using their email and password; passwords will be securely stored in Firebase Authentication.
- Login Redirect — Implement secure redirects upon successful login, navigating users to a designated home or profile page using React Router - possibly (partially) implemented
- Logout Functionality — Allow users to securely log out of the application - possibly partially implemented
- Credential Persistence Tool - The AI Tool uses reasoning to identify and then set authentication tokens with appropriate expiration, for continuous access without re-login, unless explicitly logged out.
- Authentication Status Indicator — Clearly display the user's authentication status (logged in/logged out) and username.
