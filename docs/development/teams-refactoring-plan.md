**Update (December 2024):** Additional category field support was added later:

- Added `category String` field to Team model
- Added `categories Json` field to Tournament model
- Migration: `20250613172548_add_categories_to_tournament`
- See [Database Schema Changes](database-schema-changes.md) for full details

### Code Updates âœ…

- Updated `createTeam()` function to save clubName
- Updated `getAllTeamListItems()` and `getTeamListItems()` to include clubName
- Fixed team creation action to handle clubName field
- Updated seed file to include clubName for new teams
- Updated all team displays to show `${team.clubName} ${team.teamName}` format

### Verification âœ…
