# Fly.io vs Vercel Comparison

?> The following is a transcript of a conversation with Augment.

## Is Fly.io a good alternative to Vercel?

Yes, Fly.io is an alternative to Vercel, though they have some key differences:

- Fly.io:
   - Focuses on running full-stack applications close to users
   - Deploys your apps as lightweight VMs (using Docker containers)
   - Provides global distribution with automatic regional failover
   - Offers persistent storage options (like the SQLite volume you're using)
   - Better suited for applications that need databases, background jobs, or other stateful services
   - Your project uses Fly for both the app and database deployment

- Vercel:
   - Primarily focused on frontend/JAMstack deployments
   - Excels at static site hosting and serverless functions
   - Has more built-in frontend optimizations
   - Often requires separate database hosting (like Supabase, PlanetScale, etc.)
   - Better integrated with frontend frameworks (Next.js is made by Vercel)

Your React Router v7 project is configured for Fly.io deployment with:

- Docker containerization
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments
- Persistent volume for SQLite database
- Health checks for reliability
- Staging and production environments

This setup leverages Fly's strengths for a full-stack React Router v7 application with its own database, which would require more configuration work on Vercel.

## Which one is better for React Router v7?

### React Router v7 Hosting Comparison: Fly.io vs Vercel

#### For React Router v7 Apps

##### Fly.io advantages:

- Better for full-stack React Router v7 apps with databases (like your current setup)
- Runs your app closer to where data is stored
- Handles SQLite or other databases directly (as you're using)
- Works well with React Router v7's server-side rendering model
- More control over infrastructure

##### Vercel advantages:

Simpler deployment process
Excellent Edge Functions support for React Router v7
Better built-in analytics and monitoring
Tighter integration with frontend workflows
Zero configuration for many use cases

## Which one is cheaper?

### Cost Comparison

#### Fly.io:

- Free tier: 3 shared-cpu-1x VMs (256MB RAM each, 768MB total), 3GB persistent volume, 160GB outbound data transfer
  â€¢ Included in the $5/month Hobby plan (comes with $5 usage credit)
- Pricing scales with resource usage (CPU, RAM, storage)
- Your current setup (small VM + 1GB volume) likely costs ~$5-10/month if beyond free tier

#### Vercel:

- Free tier: 100GB bandwidth, limited serverless function execution
- Pro tier: $20/month for more bandwidth, executions, and team features
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

### Which is cheaper?

- For small projects: Both have generous free tiers
- For medium projects: Fly.io is often cheaper ($5-15/month vs $20+ on Vercel)
- For high-traffic apps: Depends on usage patterns, but Fly.io gives more control over costs

### Best for your project?

Your current React Router v7 app with SQLite database is well-suited for Fly.io. The setup you have (with volumes, Docker, etc.) leverages Fly.io's strengths. Switching to Vercel would require restructuring how your database works.

If cost is the primary concern, your current Fly.io setup is likely more economical than a comparable Vercel deployment requiring a separate database service.
