# Tips & Tricks

## Best Practices

**Do:**

- Start with full context (@-mention company docs, research, templates)
- Use Socratic questions to clarify fuzzy thinking
- Generate 2-3 strategic approaches, don’t go with first idea
- Get sub-agent feedback before sharing with real team
- Drive the process yourself - AI provides options, you decide

**Don’t:**

- Let AI write for you (you’re partnering, not outsourcing)
- Skip the thinking (questions exist to sharpen YOUR judgment)
- Accept first draft (always generate alternatives to compare)
- Ignore sub-agent feedback (often catches important issues)
- Work in isolation (use full context)

**Pro Tips:**

| Tip                       | Benefit                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create methods library    | Reusable frameworks (Socratic, JTBD, RICE) for any PRD   |
| Maintain template library | Different templates for features, redesigns, experiments |
| Save great agent prompts  | Reuse personas that give valuable feedback               |
| Use checkpoints           | Save each version (v1, v2, v3) to reference alternatives |
| Document reasoning        | Note WHY you chose this approach over others             |

## Some Abbreviations

### MRR/ARR (Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue)

- Total recurring revenue from subscriptions in a month/year

- Example: 1,000 customers × $12/month × 12 months = $144,000 ARR

- Used for annual planning and company valuation

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

- Average monthly revenue per paying customer
- Example: Total monthly revenue ($50,000) ÷ Number of paying customers (5,000) = $10 ARPU
- Used to track revenue per customer over time
- In our impact model:
  - ARPU = $12/month per paying customer
  - If we add 455 activated users/month:
  - 455 × 60% conversion = 273 new paying customers/month
  - 273 × $12 ARPU = $3,276 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
  - $3,276 × 12 months = $39,312 ARR

### LTV (Lifetime Value)

- LTV (Lifetime Value) is different:
- Total revenue a customer generates over their lifetime
- Example: $12/month × 24 months average lifetime = $288 LTV
- Used to understand long-term customer value
