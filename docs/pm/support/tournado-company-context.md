# Tournado Company Context

## Company Overview

**Tournado** is a starter company and a platform designed for football tournament organizers. It provides tools for managing tournaments, teams, matches, and results.

**Founded:** 2025
**Employees:** 2 people (1 PM and 1 dev)
**Customers:** potentially amateur football clubs, local sports organizations, tournament organizers, players' family members and friends.
**Revenue:** none at the moment
**Funding:** none at the moment

## Product

Tournado is a comprehensive tournament management platform with four core modules:

1. **Tournament Management** - Create tournaments, configure formats (knockout, round-robin, group stage), manage schedules and venues
2. **Team & Registration** - Team/club registration, player rosters, waitlists, automated confirmations
3. **Match Management** - Fixture generation, results reporting, live scoring, referee assignments
4. **Communication & Social** - Real-time updates, notifications, photo sharing, spectator engagement

**Key differentiator:** Built for European football culture - multi-language support (NL/EN/DE/FR/AR/TR), local timezone handling, mobile-first for on-field updates, and integrated payment/ticketing for amateur tournaments.

## Target Customers

**Primary:** Amateur football clubs and local sports organizations running tournaments (8-64 teams)

**Personas:**

- **Tournament Organizers** - Need bracket generation, schedule management, venue coordination, results tracking
- **Club Managers** - Need team registration, player roster management, payment processing, communication with families
- **Coaches** - Need match schedules, lineup management, real-time updates during events
- **Volunteers/Referees** - Need assignments, check-in tools, match reporting
- **Parents/Fans** - Need schedules, live scores, photos, notifications

## Market Position

**Competitors:**

- **TourneyEngine** - Feature-rich but complex, expensive for small clubs
- **Challonge** - Simple brackets but limited management features
- **LeagueRepublic** - Strong UK presence but not multilingual
- **TeamSnap** - Good for leagues but weak on tournament formats
- **Tournamentsoftware.com** - Focused on racket sports, dated UX

**Tournado's edge:** Mobile-first European amateur football focus, multilingual from day one, modern UX that works on-field, affordable pricing for small clubs.

## Current Priorities

**2025 Goals:**

1. Launch MVP and acquire first 20 paying tournaments
2. Validate core tournament workflows (registration → scheduling → results)
3. Build mobile check-in and scoring tools
4. Establish partnerships with 3-5 local football clubs

**Strategic Initiatives:**

- **Mobile Experience** - Organizers need on-field updates during events (scoring, check-in, referee management)
- **Payment Integration** - Automated invoicing and payment collection for registration fees
- **Federation Integration** - Import team/player data from local football federation systems
- **Social Features** - Photo sharing, live updates, spectator engagement to differentiate from pure admin tools

## Team & Culture

**Team:**

- 2-person startup (1 PM + 1 developer)
- Bootstrap mentality - build what's essential, iterate based on real usage
- Close to the problem - both founders have organized amateur football tournaments

**Development Approach:**

- Ship small increments, validate with real tournaments
- Talk to organizers weekly, attend events to observe workflows
- Focus on mobile-first workflows that work on the sidelines
- Multilingual from day one (NL primary, EN/DE/FR/AR/TR supported)

## Customer Insights

**Pain points from organizers:**

- "We use WhatsApp, Excel, and paper clipboards - it's chaos"
- "Parents keep asking 'when does my kid play?' - need automated notifications"
- "Creating brackets for 32 teams takes hours in Excel"
- "Collecting payments and tracking who paid is painful"

**Key requirements:**

- Must work offline or with poor stadium WiFi
- Mobile check-in on tournament morning (100+ teams arriving)
- Real-time score updates visible to spectators
- Multilingual for international tournaments
- Simple enough for volunteer referees to report results

**Early feedback (from beta organizers):**

- Bracket generation saves 2-3 hours setup time
- Mobile check-in reduces registration bottlenecks
- Parents love automated notifications and live scores

## Business Context

**Revenue Model (Planned):**

- **Per-tournament pricing:** €49-199 per event (based on team count)
- **Annual club subscription:** €299/year for unlimited tournaments
- **Payment processing fee:** 2.5% on collected registration fees
- **Premium features:** Photo packages, custom branding, federation API access

**Target Economics:**

- Average tournament: 16-32 teams, €99 per event
- Organizers run 3-4 tournaments per year
- Target: 100 tournaments in year 1 (€10-15K revenue)

**Market Dynamics:**

- Amateur football clubs operate on tight budgets
- Tournament entry fees typically €50-150 per team
- Most organizers currently use free tools (Excel, WhatsApp)
- Value proposition: save 5-10 hours per tournament, reduce errors, improve parent satisfaction

## Why This Matters

You're building an **MVP in a niche market**:

- Extremely limited resources (2 people, no funding)
- Need to validate product-market fit with real tournaments
- Every feature must solve an acute organizer pain point
- Can't afford scope creep or over-engineering

Your PRDs need to balance:
✅ **Organizer needs** - Workflows that save hours, reduce stress on tournament day
✅ **Technical constraints** - Simple architecture, mobile-first, works with poor connectivity
✅ **Business viability** - Features worth paying for vs. nice-to-haves
✅ **Market differentiation** - What makes this better than Excel + WhatsApp

---

**Remember:** You're building for people who organize tournaments as volunteers, often with no technical background. Every feature needs to be obvious, mobile-friendly, and solve a real problem they face on tournament day. Your PRDs should focus ruthlessly on MVP scope and validate assumptions with real organizers.
