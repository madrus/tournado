# Tips & Tricks

## Best Practices

**Do:**

- Start with full context (@-mention company docs, research, templates)
- Use Socratic questions to clarify fuzzy thinking
- Generate 2-3 strategic approaches, don’t go with first idea
- Get sub-agent feedback before sharing with real team
- Drive the process yourself - AI provides options, you decide

**Don’t:**

- Let AI write for you (you’re partnering, not outsourcing)
- Skip the thinking (questions exist to sharpen YOUR judgment)
- Accept first draft (always generate alternatives to compare)
- Ignore sub-agent feedback (often catches important issues)
- Work in isolation (use full context)

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create methods library    | Reusable frameworks (Socratic, JTBD, RICE) for any PRD   |
| Maintain template library | Different templates for features, redesigns, experiments |
| Save great agent prompts  | Reuse personas that give valuable feedback               |
| Use checkpoints           | Save each version (v1, v2, v3) to reference alternatives |
| Document reasoning        | Note WHY you chose this approach over others             |
