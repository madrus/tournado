# RBAC Implementation Plan - January 27, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in Tournado. The RBAC utilities already exist in `app/utils/rbac.ts` but need to be integrated throughout the application.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths of Current RBAC

-  Well-defined permission system with granular permissions
-  Role hierarchy (PUBLIC → REFEREE → MANAGER → ADMIN)
-  Comprehensive utility functions for permission checking
-  UI context switching between public/admin views

### Current Gap

The RBAC system exists but isn't fully integrated into routes, components, or business logic. Currently, all authenticated users are redirected to the admin panel regardless of their role.

### Current Permissions Matrix

```typescript
const ROLE_PERMISSIONS: Record<Role, Permission[]> = {
   PUBLIC: ['teams:read', 'tournaments:read', 'matches:read'],
   REFEREE: [
      'teams:read',
      'tournaments:read',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:edit',
      'matches:referee',
   ],
   MANAGER: [
      'teams:read',
      'teams:create',
      'teams:edit',
      'teams:delete',
      'tournaments:read',
      'tournaments:create',
      'tournaments:edit',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:create',
      'matches:edit',
   ],
   ADMIN: [
      'teams:read',
      'teams:create',
      'teams:edit',
      'teams:delete',
      'teams:manage',
      'tournaments:read',
      'tournaments:create',
      'tournaments:edit',
      'tournaments:delete',
      'tournaments:manage',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:create',
      'matches:edit',
      'matches:delete',
      'matches:referee',
   ],
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Route-Level Protection (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETED

**Timeline:** Week 1-2 ✅ **Completed January 30, 2025**

#### 1.1 Update Route Loaders/Actions ✅

**Goal:** Replace current admin middleware with RBAC permission checks

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add `requirePermission()` calls to route loaders and actions
- [x] Implement role-based redirects instead of "all authenticated → admin"
- [x] Update authentication flow to redirect based on user role

**Affected Files:**

- [x] `app/routes/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/tournaments/**` - Require `tournaments:manage`
- [x] `app/routes/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/teams/**` - Require `teams:manage`
- [x] `app/routes/auth/auth.signin.tsx` - Role-based redirect logic
- [x] `app/routes/unauthorized.tsx` - Updated with role-based messaging
- [x] `app/utils/route-utils.server.ts` - Updated role mapping for consistency

**Implemented:**

```typescript
// app/utils/rbacMiddleware.server.ts
export async function requireUserWithPermission(
   request: Request,
   permission: Permission,
   options?: {
      redirectTo?: string
      allowSelfAccess?: boolean
      userIdParam?: string
   }
): Promise<User>

export async function requireAdminUser(
   request: Request,
   redirectTo = '/unauthorized'
): Promise<User>

export function getPostAuthRedirect(user: User | null, defaultRedirect?: string): string
```

#### 1.2 Create RBAC Middleware ✅

**Goal:** Create reusable middleware for permission checking

**Tasks:**

- [x] Create `withPermissionCheck()` middleware wrapper
- [x] Replace `withAdminRateLimit()` with role-aware rate limiting
- [x] Add permission-based error responses
- [x] Add comprehensive role-based error messages in 6 languages

**New Files:**

- [x] `app/utils/rbacMiddleware.server.ts` - Permission middleware
- [x] `app/utils/roleBasedRedirects.ts` - Redirect logic based on roles

**Implementation Details:**

- **Role-based redirects:** PUBLIC/REFEREE → `/teams`, ADMIN/MANAGER → `/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1`
- **Translation integration:** All unauthorized messages now use i18n with role-specific messaging
- **Rate limiting:** Maintained existing rate limiting while adding role-aware functionality
- **Test coverage:** All tests passing (1618 tests) including updated unauthorized page tests

### Phase 2: Component-Level Access Control (High Priority)

**Timeline:** Week 3-4

#### 2.1 Navigation Updates ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Show/hide navigation items based on user permissions

**Tasks:**

- [x] ~~Update `AdminLayout` to show/hide menu items based on permissions~~ → **Updated AppBar and BottomNavigation components instead**
- [x] Implement `canAccess()` checks for navigation components
- [x] Add role-based menu item filtering

**Affected Components:**

- [x] `app/components/AppBar.tsx` - Updated with permission-based menu filtering
- [x] `app/components/mobileNavigation/BottomNavigation.tsx` - Added role-based URL routing

**Implementation Details:**

```typescript
// In AppBar.tsx
const canManageTournaments = canAccess(user || null, 'tournaments:manage')
const canManageTeams = canAccess(user || null, 'teams:manage')

const menuItems = [
   // Tournaments - only show for users who can manage tournaments (ADMIN, MANAGER)
   ...(canManageTournaments
      ? [
           {
              label: t('common.titles.tournaments'),
              icon: 'trophy' as IconName,
              href: '/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/tournaments',
              authenticated: true,
           },
        ]
      : []),
   {
      label: t('common.titles.teams'),
      icon: 'apparel' as IconName,
      href: canManageTeams ? '/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/teams' : '/teams',
      authenticated: false,
   },
   // ... other items
]
```

```typescript
// In BottomNavigation.tsx
const user = useOptionalUser()
const canManageTeams = canAccess(user || null, 'teams:manage')

const navigationItems = [
   { to: '/', icon: 'trophy', label: 'Home' },
   {
      // Teams link goes to admin teams if user can manage teams, otherwise public teams
      to: canManageTeams ? '/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/teams' : '/teams',
      icon: 'apparel',
      label: 'Teams',
   },
   { to: '/about', icon: 'pending', label: 'More' },
]
```

**Key Achievements:**

- ✅ **Permission-Based Navigation**: Navigation items now dynamically show/hide based on user permissions
- ✅ **Smart URL Routing**: Users with management permissions get admin URLs, others get public URLs
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Used existing `useOptionalUser()` hook instead of prop drilling
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: All navigation tests pass (34/34) with fallback handling for test environments
- ✅ **Role Matrix Integration**: Proper integration with established RBAC permission matrix

## FAQ: Common RBAC Implementation Questions

### Q: What happens if I add a new feature and forget to add it to RBAC?

**A:** Several serious security and usability issues will occur:

#### 🚨 Security Vulnerabilities

**1. Unauthorized Access**

- **All authenticated users** can access the new feature regardless of their role
- A REFEREE could access ADMIN-only functionality
- PUBLIC users might access sensitive management features

**2. Privilege Escalation**

- Users can perform actions beyond their intended permissions
- Could lead to data manipulation or deletion by unauthorized users
- Potential for accidental or malicious system damage

#### 🔍 What Would Happen in Practice

**Route-Level Issues:**

```typescript
// New feature route WITHOUT RBAC protection
export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderArgs) => {
   // ❌ Missing: requirePermission(user, 'newfeature:read')
   const user = await getUser(request)

   // Anyone authenticated can access this!
   return await getNewFeatureData()
}
```

**Component-Level Issues:**

```typescript
// New action button WITHOUT permission check
function NewFeatureButton() {
  // ❌ Missing: canAccess(user, 'newfeature:create')

  // All users see this button regardless of role
  return <ActionLinkButton to="/new-feature/create">Create New Feature</ActionLinkButton>
}
```

**Navigation Issues:**

```typescript
// Admin menu WITHOUT role filtering
const menuItems = [
   { path: '/tournaments', permission: 'tournaments:read' },
   { path: '/teams', permission: 'teams:read' },
   // ❌ Missing permission check for new feature
   { path: '/new-feature', label: 'New Feature' },
]
```

#### 📊 Impact Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New Admin Feature**

- **Intent**: Only ADMIN should access user management
- **Reality**: All authenticated users can manage other users
- **Risk**: Data breach, unauthorized user creation/deletion

**Scenario 2: New Referee Feature**

- **Intent**: Only REFEREE can submit match scores
- **Reality**: Anyone can submit/modify match results
- **Risk**: Tournament integrity compromised

**Scenario 3: New Public Feature**

- **Intent**: Enhanced team registration for PUBLIC users
- **Reality**: Works as intended (but still needs explicit permission)
- **Risk**: Lower, but inconsistent security model

#### 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

**1. Development Checklist**

```markdown
When adding new features:

- [ ] Define required permission in rbac.ts
- [ ] Add permission to appropriate roles
- [ ] Add requirePermission() to route loaders/actions
- [ ] Add canAccess() checks to components
- [ ] Update navigation permission filters
- [ ] Write tests for permission enforcement
```

**2. Code Review Requirements**

- [ ] **Mandatory RBAC review** for all new features
- [ ] **Security review** for permission matrix changes
- [ ] **Test coverage** for new permission combinations

**3. Automated Detection**

```typescript
// Lint rule idea: Detect routes without permission checks
// ESLint custom rule to flag missing requirePermission()
```

**4. Default Deny Approach**

```typescript
// Fail-safe: Default to most restrictive permission
const getRequiredPermission = (route: string): Permission => {
   const routePermissions = {
      '/tournaments': 'tournaments:read',
      '/teams': 'teams:read',
      // ... other routes
   }

   // ✅ Default to admin-only for unmapped routes
   return routePermissions[route] || 'admin:access'
}
```

#### 🔧 Recommended Safeguards

**1. RBAC Integration Testing**

```typescript
// Test that runs after each deployment
describe('RBAC Coverage', () => {
   test('all routes have permission requirements', () => {
      const routes = getAllRoutes()
      routes.forEach(route => {
         expect(route).toHavePermissionCheck()
      })
   })
})
```

**2. Permission Audit Script**

```bash
# Check for routes without RBAC
grep -r "export const loader" app/routes/ | grep -v "requirePermission"
```

**3. Feature Flag Integration**

```typescript
// New features behind feature flags with RBAC
if (isFeatureEnabled('newFeature') && hasPermission(user, 'newfeature:access')) {
   // Show new feature
}
```

#### 📋 Quick Fix Process

If you discover an unprotected feature:

1. [ ] **Immediate**: Add permission check to route loader
2. [ ] **Short-term**: Add component-level checks
3. [ ] **Long-term**: Add comprehensive tests
4. [ ] **Review**: Audit similar features for gaps

**Key takeaway:** Make RBAC checks a **mandatory part of the development workflow** rather than an afterthought.

---

**Note:** This implementation plan builds on the existing RBAC utilities in `app/utils/rbac.ts` and integrates them throughout the application to provide proper role-based access control as outlined in the PRD.

## Recent Updates - January 31, 2025

### PUBLIC User Redirect Fix ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue:** PUBLIC users were being redirected to `/teams` after login instead of the homepage.

**Solution:** Updated role-based redirect logic to send PUBLIC users to homepage (`/`) instead of teams page.

#### Files Modified:

1. **`app/utils/roleBasedRedirects.ts`**
   - Changed `PUBLIC: '/teams'` to `PUBLIC: '/'` in `ROLE_LANDING_PAGES`
   - Updated fallback redirects from `/teams` to `/`
   - Updated error redirects for PUBLIC users to use homepage

2. **`playwright/tests/auth.spec.ts`**
   - Updated test name from "redirect to teams page" to "redirect to homepage"
   - Changed expected URL assertion from `/teams` to `/`
   - Fixed email selector specificity issue in authentication verification

3. **`playwright/pages/SignInPage.ts`**
   - Added optional `expectedRedirect` parameter to `signIn()` method
   - Made authentication verification conditional based on redirect destination
   - Enhanced flexibility for different user role testing

#### Test Results:

- ✅ **PUBLIC users** now correctly redirect to homepage (`/`) after registration/login
- ✅ **ADMIN/MANAGER/REFEREE users** still redirect to admin panel (`/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1`)
- ✅ All authentication tests passing
- ✅ Playwright E2E tests updated and working correctly

#### Impact:

- **Better UX:** New PUBLIC users land on the welcoming homepage instead of directly in teams
- **Consistent Design:** Homepage provides better onboarding and navigation options
- **Role Clarity:** Clear distinction between public user experience and admin user experience
