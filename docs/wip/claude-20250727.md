# RBAC Implementation Plan - January 27, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in Tournado. The RBAC utilities already exist in `app/utils/rbac.ts` but need to be integrated throughout the application.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths of Target RBAC

-  Well-defined permission system with granular permissions
-  Role hierarchy (UNAUTHENTICATED � PUBLIC � REFEREE � MANAGER � ADMIN)
-  Comprehensive utility functions for permission checking
-  UI context switching between public/admin views

### Current Gap

The RBAC system exists but isn't integrated into routes, components, or business logic. Currently, all authenticated users are redirected to the admin panel regardless of their role.

### Existing Permissions Matrix

```typescript
const ROLE_PERMISSIONS: Record<Role | 'UNAUTHENTICATED', Permission[]> = {
   PUBLIC: ['teams:read', 'tournaments:read', 'matches:read'],
   REFEREE: ['teams:read', 'tournaments:read', 'matches:read', 'matches:referee'],
   REFEREE_COORDINATOR: [
      'teams:read',
      'tournaments:read',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:create',
      'matches:edit',
      'matches:referee',
   ],
   TOURNAMENT_MANAGER: [
      'teams:read',
      'teams:create',
      'teams:edit',
      'teams:delete',
      'tournaments:read',
      'tournaments:create',
      'tournaments:edit',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:create',
      'matches:edit',
   ],
   ADMIN: [
      'teams:read',
      'teams:create',
      'teams:edit',
      'teams:delete',
      'teams:manage',
      'tournaments:read',
      'tournaments:create',
      'tournaments:edit',
      'tournaments:delete',
      'tournaments:manage',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:create',
      'matches:edit',
      'matches:delete',
      'matches:referee',
   ],
   UNAUTHENTICATED: ['teams:read', 'tournaments:read', 'matches:read'],
}
```

## Implementation Plan

## FAQ: Common RBAC Implementation Questions

### Q: What happens if I add a new feature and forget to add it to RBAC?

**A:** Several serious security and usability issues will occur:

#### 🚨 Security Vulnerabilities

**1. Unauthorized Access**

- **All authenticated users** can access the new feature regardless of their role
- A REFEREE could access ADMIN-only functionality
- PUBLIC users might access sensitive management features

**2. Privilege Escalation**

- Users can perform actions beyond their intended permissions
- Could lead to data manipulation or deletion by unauthorized users
- Potential for accidental or malicious system damage

#### 🔍 What Would Happen in Practice

**Route-Level Issues:**

```typescript
// New feature route WITHOUT RBAC protection
export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderArgs) => {
   // ❌ Missing: requirePermission(user, 'newfeature:read')
   const user = await getUser(request)

   // Anyone authenticated can access this!
   return await getNewFeatureData()
}
```

**Component-Level Issues:**

```typescript
// New action button WITHOUT permission check
function NewFeatureButton() {
  // ❌ Missing: canAccess(user, 'newfeature:create')

  // All users see this button regardless of role
  return <ActionLinkButton to="/new-feature/create">Create New Feature</ActionLinkButton>
}
```

**Navigation Issues:**

```typescript
// Admin menu WITHOUT role filtering
const menuItems = [
   { path: '/tournaments', permission: 'tournaments:read' },
   { path: '/teams', permission: 'teams:read' },
   // ❌ Missing permission check for new feature
   { path: '/new-feature', label: 'New Feature' },
]
```

#### 📊 Impact Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New Admin Feature**

- **Intent**: Only ADMIN should access user management
- **Reality**: All authenticated users can manage other users
- **Risk**: Data breach, unauthorized user creation/deletion

**Scenario 2: New Referee Feature**

- **Intent**: Only REFEREE can submit match scores
- **Reality**: Anyone can submit/modify match results
- **Risk**: Tournament integrity compromised

**Scenario 3: New Public Feature**

- **Intent**: Enhanced team registration for PUBLIC users
- **Reality**: Works as intended (but still needs explicit permission)
- **Risk**: Lower, but inconsistent security model

#### 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

**1. Development Checklist**

```markdown
When adding new features:

- [ ] Define required permission in rbac.ts
- [ ] Add permission to appropriate roles
- [ ] Add requirePermission() to route loaders/actions
- [ ] Add canAccess() checks to components
- [ ] Update navigation permission filters
- [ ] Write tests for permission enforcement
```

**2. Code Review Requirements**

- [ ] **Mandatory RBAC review** for all new features
- [ ] **Security review** for permission matrix changes
- [ ] **Test coverage** for new permission combinations

**3. Automated Detection**

```typescript
// Lint rule idea: Detect routes without permission checks
// ESLint custom rule to flag missing requirePermission()
```

**4. Default Deny Approach**

```typescript
// Fail-safe: Default to most restrictive permission
const getRequiredPermission = (route: string): Permission => {
   const routePermissions = {
      '/tournaments': 'tournaments:read',
      '/teams': 'teams:read',
      // ... other routes
   }

   // ✅ Default to admin-only for unmapped routes
   return routePermissions[route] || 'admin:access'
}
```

#### 🔧 Recommended Safeguards

**1. RBAC Integration Testing**

```typescript
// Test that runs after each deployment
describe('RBAC Coverage', () => {
   test('all routes have permission requirements', () => {
      const routes = getAllRoutes()
      routes.forEach(route => {
         expect(route).toHavePermissionCheck()
      })
   })
})
```

**2. Permission Audit Script**

```bash
# Check for routes without RBAC
grep -r "export const loader" app/routes/ | grep -v "requirePermission"
```

**3. Feature Flag Integration**

```typescript
// New features behind feature flags with RBAC
if (isFeatureEnabled('newFeature') && hasPermission(user, 'newfeature:access')) {
   // Show new feature
}
```

#### 📋 Quick Fix Process

If you discover an unprotected feature:

1. [ ] **Immediate**: Add permission check to route loader
2. [ ] **Short-term**: Add component-level checks
3. [ ] **Long-term**: Add comprehensive tests
4. [ ] **Review**: Audit similar features for gaps

**Key takeaway:** Make RBAC checks a **mandatory part of the development workflow** rather than an afterthought.

**Note:** This implementation plan builds on the existing RBAC utilities in `app/utils/rbac.ts` and integrates them throughout the application to provide proper role-based access control as outlined in the PRD.
