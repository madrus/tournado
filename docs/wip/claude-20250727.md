# RBAC Implementation Plan - January 27, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in Tournado. The RBAC utilities already exist in `app/utils/rbac.ts` but need to be integrated throughout the application.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths of Existing RBAC

-  Well-defined permission system with granular permissions
-  Role hierarchy (UNAUTHENTICATED � PUBLIC � REFEREE � REFEREE_COORDINATOR � TOURNAMENT_MANAGER � ADMIN)
-  Comprehensive utility functions for permission checking
-  UI context switching between public/admin views

### Current Gap

The RBAC system exists but isn't integrated into routes, components, or business logic. Currently, all authenticated users are redirected to the admin panel regardless of their role.

### Existing Permissions Matrix

```typescript
const ROLE_PERMISSIONS: Record<Role | 'UNAUTHENTICATED', Permission[]> = {
   PUBLIC: ['teams:read', 'tournaments:read', 'matches:read'],
   REFEREE: ['teams:read', 'tournaments:read', 'matches:read', 'matches:referee'],
   REFEREE_COORDINATOR: [
      'teams:read',
      'tournaments:read',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:create',
      'matches:edit',
      'matches:referee',
   ],
   TOURNAMENT_MANAGER: [
      'teams:read',
      'teams:create',
      'teams:edit',
      'teams:delete',
      'tournaments:read',
      'tournaments:create',
      'tournaments:edit',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:create',
      'matches:edit',
   ],
   ADMIN: [
      'teams:read',
      'teams:create',
      'teams:edit',
      'teams:delete',
      'teams:manage',
      'tournaments:read',
      'tournaments:create',
      'tournaments:edit',
      'tournaments:delete',
      'tournaments:manage',
      'matches:read',
      'matches:create',
      'matches:edit',
      'matches:delete',
      'matches:referee',
   ],
   UNAUTHENTICATED: ['teams:read', 'tournaments:read', 'matches:read'],
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Route-Level Protection (High Priority)

**Timeline:** Week 1-2

#### 1.1 Update Route Loaders/Actions

**Goal:** Replace current admin middleware with RBAC permission checks

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Add `requirePermission()` calls to route loaders and actions
- [ ] Implement role-based redirects instead of "all authenticated → admin"
- [ ] Update authentication flow to redirect based on user role

**Affected Files:**

- [ ] `app/routes/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/tournaments/**` - Require `tournaments:manage`
- [ ] `app/routes/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/teams/**` - Require `teams:manage`
- [ ] `app/routes/auth/auth.signin.tsx` - Role-based redirect logic
- [ ] `app/root.tsx` - Update session handling

**Example Implementation:**

```typescript
// app/routes/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/tournaments/new.tsx
export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderArgs) => {
   const user = await getUser(request)
   requirePermission(user, 'tournaments:create')
   return {}
}
```

#### 1.2 Create RBAC Middleware

- [ ] Test edge cases and invalid permissions

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test route protection and component access
- [ ] Verify middleware functionality
- [ ] Test role-based redirects

### End-to-End Tests

- [ ] Test complete user journeys for each role
- [ ] Verify navigation and feature access
- [ ] Test role transitions and permission changes

### Security Tests

- [ ] Verify permission bypasses are impossible
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Validate role escalation prevention

## Technical Considerations

### Migration Strategy

1. [ ] **Gradual Rollout:** Implement role checks alongside existing admin checks
2. [ ] **Feature Flags:** Use environment variables to toggle RBAC features
3. [ ] **Fallback Logic:** Maintain current admin access while implementing new roles

### Performance Implications

- [ ] Permission checks are lightweight utility functions
- [ ] Consider caching user permissions in session
- [ ] Minimize database queries for role verification

### Security Implications

- [ ] All permission checks must be server-side
- [ ] Client-side checks are for UX only, not security
- [ ] Implement defense-in-depth with multiple permission layers

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics

- [ ] All routes properly protected by appropriate permissions
- [ ] Navigation correctly filtered based on user roles
- [ ] Forms and actions respect permission boundaries

### User Experience Metrics

- [ ] Role-appropriate interfaces reduce confusion
- [ ] Users can accomplish their tasks efficiently
- [ ] Clear feedback when permissions are insufficient

### Security Metrics

- [ ] No unauthorized access to protected resources
- [ ] Permission violations properly logged and blocked
- [ ] Role boundaries effectively enforced

## Next Steps

1. [ ] **Start with Phase 1:** Begin implementing route-level protection
2. [ ] **Create Migration Plan:** Plan transition from current admin-only system
3. [ ] **Set Up Testing:** Establish test suite for RBAC functionality
4. [ ] **Documentation:** Update user guides for different roles

---

**Note:** This implementation plan builds on the existing RBAC utilities in `app/utils/rbac.ts` and integrates them throughout the application to provide proper role-based access control as outlined in the PRD.
