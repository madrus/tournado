# Tournado Vitest MCP Server ✅ COMPLETED

A **production-ready** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for running vitest tests and analyzing coverage in the Tournado project. This server enables AI-assisted test-driven development workflows and is ready for extraction into a reusable package.

## 🎉 Final Implementation Status

### ✅ 3 Robust Tools Available

1. **`ping`** - Health check tool (returns "pong")
2. **`run-vitest`** - Execute complete test suite with detailed results
3. **`run-vitest-coverage`** - Execute tests with comprehensive coverage analysis

### 📊 Coverage Analysis Features

- **File-by-file coverage breakdown** with percentages for lines, functions, statements, and branches
- **Smart status indicators**: ❌ No coverage, ✅ Perfect coverage, ⚠️ Partial coverage
- **Uncovered line detection** with smart formatting: "all" (0% coverage), "none" (100% coverage), or ranges (e.g., "43-44, 49-50, 52, 63-64")
- **Handles 0% coverage files** properly by detecting all uncovered executable lines
- **Clean data structure** optimized for AI consumption

### 🎯 Current Project Status

- ✅ **98/98 tests passing** across 9 test suites
- ✅ **Complete coverage analysis** for 78+ files in the `app/` directory
- ✅ **Production-ready** for AI-assisted development workflows
- ✅ **Fully integrated** with Cursor MCP interface

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Running Tests

```bash
# Via MCP tools in Cursor
ping                    # Returns "pong" - health check
run-vitest             # Execute all tests with detailed results
run-vitest-coverage    # Execute tests + comprehensive coverage analysis
```

### Coverage Output Structure

## ⚙️ Cursor MCP Configuration

Add this to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "vitest-runner": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
            "/Users/madrus/dev/biz/toernooien/tournado/mcp-servers/vitest/dist/index.js"
         ],
         "cwd": "/Users/madrus/dev/biz/toernooien/tournado"
      }
   }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Development & Building

### Building After Changes

```bash
cd mcp-servers/vitest
npm run build
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

```bash
# From project root (/Users/madrus/dev/biz/toernooien/tournado)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./mcp-servers/vitest/dist/index.js
```

## 🔄 Development History & Lessons Learned

### Evolution from 4 Tools to 3 Tools

**Initial Plan**: 4 tools including `get-file-coverage` with custom parameters
**Problem**: Cursor MCP interface limitations with custom parameters
**Solution**: Enhanced `run-vitest-coverage` to include all file coverage details

### Key Technical Achievements

1. **Robust Coverage Analysis**:

   - Extracts uncovered lines even for files with 0% test coverage
   - Groups consecutive lines into readable ranges
   - Provides clear status indicators for each file

2. **Clean Data Architecture**:

   - Removed redundant nesting in JSON responses
   - Direct file-to-coverage mapping
   - Optimized for AI agent consumption

3. **Environment Resilience**:
   - Works perfectly in MCP Inspector
   - Handles Cursor MCP interface limitations gracefully
   - Proper error handling and parameter validation

### Problems Solved

1. **Tool Discovery Issue** ❌ → ✅

   - **Problem**: Only `ping` tool detected by Cursor
   - **Cause**: Tool registrations commented out in compiled JavaScript
   - **Solution**: Fixed imports and proper build process

2. **Parameter Handling** ❌ → ✅

   - **Problem**: `get-file-coverage` crashed with undefined parameters
   - **Cause**: Cursor passes dummy parameters to all tools
   - **Solution**: Removed tool, enhanced coverage tool with comprehensive data

3. **Coverage Data Quality** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: Missing uncovered lines for files with 0% coverage
   - **Cause**: Logic gaps in coverage extraction
   - **Solution**: Enhanced extraction to handle all coverage scenarios

- Generic project configuration (not Tournado-specific)
- Command-line arguments for project paths
- Configurable vitest options
- Published npm package for reuse

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Reference

### Working Directory Requirements

⚠️ **Critical**: MCP server must run from project root (`/Users/madrus/dev/biz/toernooien/tournado`)

### Build Process

💡 **Remember**: Run `npm run build` after TypeScript changes

### Cursor Integration

🔧 **Config**: Use absolute paths in MCP server configuration for reliability
