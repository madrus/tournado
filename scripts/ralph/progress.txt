## Codebase Patterns
- Tournament and GroupStage require createdBy; seed data and fixtures must set it explicitly.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added required createdBy ownership for Tournament and GroupStage, updated creation flows and seed data, and backfilled via migration
- Added unit tests for createTournament and createGroupStage createdBy behavior
- Files changed: prisma/schema.prisma, prisma/migrations/20260115190818_add_createdby_to_tournament_and_groupstage/migration.sql, prisma/seed.js, app/models/tournament.server.ts, app/models/group.server.ts, app/routes/admin/tournaments/tournaments.new.tsx, app/routes/admin/competition/competition.groups.new.tsx, app/models/__tests__/tournament.server.test.ts, app/models/__tests__/group.server.test.ts, app/utils/__tests__/email.server.test.tsx, app/features/teams/utils/__tests__/teamCreation.server.test.ts, test/routes/admin/tournaments/tournaments.$tournamentId.test.tsx, test/routes/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/tournaments/tournaments.$tournamentId.loader.test.ts, test/routes/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/competition/competition.groups.new.loader.test.ts, test/routes/a7k9m2x5p8w1n4q6r3y8b5t1/competition/competition.groups.$groupStageId.loader.test.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CreatedBy is now required on Tournament and GroupStage; seed data must set it explicitly.
  - Migration backfill uses the user with email madrus@gmail.com.
  - Prisma relation fields need matching User back-relations to avoid schema validation errors.

- Added deleteGroupStage test coverage to ensure team records are not deleted during group stage removal
- Files changed: app/models/__tests__/group.server.test.ts, scripts/ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Deleting a group stage should only touch group slots, groups, and the stage itself; team records must remain untouched.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Added canDeleteGroupStage validation with impact counts and PLAYED match blocking logic
- Added unit tests covering blocked deletion, non-played matches, and no matches cases
- Files changed: app/models/group.server.ts, app/models/__tests__/group.server.test.ts, scripts/ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - canDeleteGroupStage derives impact from Group/GroupSlot counts and match status for assigned teams using MatchStatus enum.
