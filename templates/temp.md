# Notes

## My First Prompt

I'm trying to rethink my whole project by adding project documentation
that can guide me and the agents. AI and agents, I mean. In our work on the project.
We start with three template documents that are in the templates folder.
Here are the links: @/templates/PRD-template.mdc @/templates/ARD-Template.mdc @/templates/Task-Template.mdc .
We will be working on these templates. As background information, I give you two other files.
Here they are: @/PRD.mdc @/EXTRA.md . Your task is to look through all these files, take the templates as bases,
keeping in mind that these templates are partially copied from another project which was based on Next.js and Python
and it was backend and frontend whereas my project is only frontend with React, React Router 7, `TypeScript`, Vite,
and Zustand. So some things in the templates that you see now do not fit my project, so I need you to go through them
to change anything that relates to the Python Next.js project and make it fit this project.
If necessary, you can go through the codebase; if necessary, you can ask me questions.
But I need to have these templates in order to create the real documents. But that will be the next step.
For now, I need only the templates that are general enough. And keep also in mind that I'm going
to add authentication via Google authentication in Firestore, and there will be two - I think it's going too far,
no, this is not for the template. In the template, we'll just mention that it should be Google authentication.
In the real documents, I will go into more details. Looking at the reference PRD, that is the old PRD
that I had for this project. It is very verbose, there is a lot of information there. You only look at it for now
as a reference in what kind of template questions we will be answering later. You don't have to use that text,
only the ideas for now. And of course eliminate all references to Python and Next.js as I have no back-end.
