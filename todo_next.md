# Panel Refactor & Tailwind v4 Dark-Variant Migration Plan

> Owner: **frontend team**
> Status: **Draft ‚Äì please keep this file up-to-date**

---

## üéØ Goal

Unify every ‚Äúpanel-like‚Äù UI element under **one generic `Panel` wrapper** (capital-P directory), adopt native Tailwind v4 `@dark:` syntax across the codebase, and retire the old implementation only after all imports are updated.

---

## Phase 1‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇPreparation

- [x] Create tracking branch `feat/panel-refactor`.
- [x] Inventory legacy usage:
   ```bash
   grep -R "from '~/components/Panel'" app | wc -l
   grep -R "getPanelClasses(" app | wc -l
   ```
- [x] Produce a checklist of legacy callers and test files.
- [x] **Validation & commit:** ensure `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` pass; commit the branch state.

---

## Phase 2‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇLegacy Isolation

- [x] **Rename file** `app/components/Panel.tsx` ‚Üí `app/components/PanelOld.tsx` and `export function PanelOld ‚Ä¶`.
- [x] **Automated import shim** ‚Äì temporarily rewrite existing imports:
   ```ts
   import { PanelOld as Panel } from '~/components/PanelOld'
   ```
- [x] Ensure the repo compiles with the shim in place.
- [x] **Validation & commit:** repo must lint, type-check, and test cleanly; push interim commit.

---

## Phase 3‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇNew Package

- [x] Create directory structure:
   ```
   app/components/Panel/
     ‚îú‚îÄ Panel.tsx            # generic wrapper
     ‚îú‚îÄ panel.variants.ts    # Tailwind-v4 CVA map
     ‚îú‚îÄ index.ts             # barrel export
     ‚îî‚îÄ panel.types.ts       # shared types (optional)
   ```
- [x] Copy `components/shared/panel.variants.ts` ‚Üí `panel.variants.ts` and replace every `dark:` with `@dark:`.
- [x] Keep the old shared variant file in place until Phase 6.
- [x] **Create Panel.tsx** making it possible to implement the following variants:
   - [x] Static background panel `<div className="absolute inset-0" />` using `panelVariants({ color })`.
   - [x] Base content container (`opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-0`).
   - [x] Optional hover overlay (`opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`) rendered only when `hoverColor` prop is provided.
- [x] **Compliance check:** `grep -R --line-number "dark:" app/components/Panel | grep -v "@dark:"` returns no results (ensures Panel package uses only `@dark:` syntax).
- [x] Replace every `dark:` utility inside **panel-specific** TypeScript/JSX code (variants, tests) with `@dark:` to use the new inline directive.
- [x] **Validation & commit:** all quality checks pass; open draft PR or commit.

---

## Phase 4‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇEarly-Adopter Migration

- [x] **Trim ActionLinkPanel files**
   - [x] Refactor `PanelBackground.tsx` and `PanelLayer.tsx` via the new `Panel`.
   - [x] **Fixed height issues:** Restored three-layer architecture with proper positioning (base: `relative z-20`, hover: `absolute inset-0 z-30`)
   - [x] **Fixed hover transitions:** Proper opacity transitions (750ms) between base and hover layers
   - [x] **Fixed brand color mapping:** Brand colors now use semantic gradients that map to red (light) and slate (dark)
   - [x] **Fixed icon color on hover:** Icons properly change to red when hovering with `hoverColor='brand'`
   - [x] **Fixed children text color:** Children text maintains original color (doesn't change on hover)
   - [x] **Fixed duplicate borders:** Removed conflicting styling between PanelBackground and Panel component
   - [ ] Update/replace unit tests to cover hover opacity toggle and link behaviour.
- [x] **Admin dashboard (5 tiles)** ‚Äì verify UI in light & dark mode; gradients must still match the `@variant dark` overrides in `tailwind.css`.
- [x] **CVA Compliance Issues Identified:**
   - [ ] Use semantic class names (`panel-teal`, `panel-brand`) in ActionLinkPanel and its children as much as possible ‚Üí fix usage of the actual Tailwind classes
- [x] **Validation & commit:** run full quality suite; merge PR-1 once green.

---

## Phase 5‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇIncremental Adoption

- [x] Migrate `TeamForm`, `TournamentForm`, and any list/index pages to the new `Panel` API.
- [x] Convert all `dark:` utilities in touched files to `@dark:`.
- [x] Run `vitest` + Playwright visual tests.
- [x] **Eliminate `getPanelClasses`**
   - [x] Replace each call with `panel.variants` helpers or direct Tailwind classes.
   - [x] Update associated unit tests and snapshots.
- [x] **Validation & commit:** ensure lint/type/test pass after each migrated file set; commit frequently.

## Phase 6 ¬∑ Comprehensive Panel Refactoring & Cleanup

### 6.1 Enhanced Panel Component Development

- [x] **Enhance Panel component** to support all identified use cases:
   - [x] Add `variant` prop: `'content-panel' | 'dashboard-panel' | 'form-panel'` (semantic variants)
   - [ ] Add `size` prop: `'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'` for different panel scales
   - [ ] Add `number` prop for form step indicators (migrate from TeamForm/TournamentForm)
   - [ ] Add `disabled` prop for form step progression
   - [ ] Add interaction props: `onClick`, `href` for action panels
   - [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing ActionLinkPanel usage (layer variants preserved)

### 6.2 Content Panel Migration (Simple ‚Üí Complex)

- [x] **TeamForm success message migration:**
   - [x] Replace custom div with Panel component using `variant='content-panel'`
   - [x] Convert icon structure to use Panel's `icon` prop
   - [x] Maintain existing visual styling and behavior
   - [x] Simplify component structure (15 lines ‚Üí 8 lines)
- [ ] **TournamentForm success message migration:**
   - [ ] Same migration steps as TeamForm

   npx jscodeshift -t scripts/codemods/dark-to-dark.js app/components
   ```
- [ ] **Delete legacy files:**
   - [ ] `app/components/PanelOld.tsx`
   - [ ] `app/components/shared/panel.variants.ts`
   - [ ] `app/styles/panel.styles.ts` (removes `getPanelClasses` and legacy helpers)
- [ ] **Remove temporary import shims:**

### 6.7 Final Cleanup

- [ ] **Validation & commit:** final green run of lint, typecheck, tests before deleting legacy files; open PR-2.
- [ ] **Remove legacy declaration** `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));` from `app/styles/tailwind.css` once all other files compile with `@dark:` or `@variant dark`.
- [ ] **Documentation update:** Update any component documentation to reflect new Panel API
- [ ] **Performance audit:** Ensure no CSS duplication or unused styles remain

## Phase 7‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇGuardrails

- [ ] Add ESLint / CI check to reject `dark:` classes (that aren‚Äôt `@dark:`) in any `*.tsx` under `app/components/`.
   ```bash
   grep -R --line-number "dark:" app/components | grep -v "@dark:" && exit 1
   ```
- [ ] **Validation & commit:** CI must fail if rule violated; merge guardrail enforcement PR.
