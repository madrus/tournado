# Panel Refactor & Tailwind v4 Dark-Variant Migration Plan

> Owner: **frontend team**
> Status: **Draft ‚Äì please keep this file up-to-date**

---

## üéØ Goal

Unify every ‚Äúpanel-like‚Äù UI element under **one generic `Panel` wrapper** (capital-P directory), adopt native Tailwind v4 `@dark:` syntax across the codebase, and retire the old implementation only after all imports are updated.

---

## Phase 1‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇPreparation

- [x] Create tracking branch `feat/panel-refactor`.
- [x] Inventory legacy usage:
   ```bash
   grep -R "from '~/components/Panel'" app | wc -l
   grep -R "getPanelClasses(" app | wc -l
   ```
- [x] Produce a checklist of legacy callers and test files.
- [x] **Validation & commit:** ensure `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` pass; commit the branch state.

---

## Phase 2‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇLegacy Isolation

- [x] **Rename file** `app/components/Panel.tsx` ‚Üí `app/components/PanelOld.tsx` and `export function PanelOld ‚Ä¶`.
- [x] **Automated import shim** ‚Äì temporarily rewrite existing imports:
   ```ts
   import { PanelOld as Panel } from '~/components/PanelOld'
   ```
- [x] Ensure the repo compiles with the shim in place.
- [x] **Validation & commit:** repo must lint, type-check, and test cleanly; push interim commit.

---

## Phase 3‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇNew Package

- [x] Create directory structure:
   ```
   app/components/Panel/
     ‚îú‚îÄ Panel.tsx            # generic wrapper
     ‚îú‚îÄ panel.variants.ts    # Tailwind-v4 CVA map
     ‚îú‚îÄ index.ts             # barrel export
     ‚îî‚îÄ panel.types.ts       # shared types (optional)
   ```
- [x] Copy `components/shared/panel.variants.ts` ‚Üí `panel.variants.ts` and replace every `dark:` with `@dark:`.
- [x] Keep the old shared variant file in place until Phase 6.
- [x] **Create Panel.tsx** making it possible to implement the following variants:
   - [x] Static background panel `<div className="absolute inset-0" />` using `panelVariants({ color })`.
   - [x] Base content container (`opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-0`).
   - [x] Optional hover overlay (`opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`) rendered only when `hoverColor` prop is provided.
- [x] **Compliance check:** `grep -R --line-number "dark:" app/components/Panel | grep -v "@dark:"` returns no results (ensures Panel package uses only `@dark:` syntax).
- [x] Replace every `dark:` utility inside **panel-specific** TypeScript/JSX code (variants, tests) with `@dark:` to use the new inline directive.
- [x] **Validation & commit:** all quality checks pass; open draft PR or commit.

---

## Phase 4‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇEarly-Adopter Migration

- [x] **Trim ActionLinkPanel files**
   - [x] Refactor `PanelBackground.tsx` and `PanelLayer.tsx` via the new `Panel`.
   - [x] **Fixed height issues:** Restored three-layer architecture with proper positioning (base: `relative z-20`, hover: `absolute inset-0 z-30`)
   - [x] **Fixed hover transitions:** Proper opacity transitions (750ms) between base and hover layers
   - [x] **Fixed brand color mapping:** Brand colors now use semantic gradients that map to red (light) and slate (dark)
   - [x] **Fixed icon color on hover:** Icons properly change to red when hovering with `hoverColor='brand'`
   - [x] **Fixed children text color:** Children text maintains original color (doesn't change on hover)
   - [x] **Fixed duplicate borders:** Removed conflicting styling between PanelBackground and Panel component
   - [ ] Update/replace unit tests to cover hover opacity toggle and link behaviour.
- [x] **Admin dashboard (5 tiles)** ‚Äì verify UI in light & dark mode; gradients must still match the `@variant dark` overrides in `tailwind.css`.
- [x] **CVA Compliance Issues Identified:**
   - [ ] Use semantic class names (`panel-teal`, `panel-brand`) in ActionLinkPanel and its children as much as possible ‚Üí fix usage of the actual Tailwind classes
- [x] **Validation & commit:** run full quality suite; merge PR-1 once green.

---

## Phase 5‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇIncremental Adoption

- [x] Migrate `TeamForm`, `TournamentForm`, and any list/index pages to the new `Panel` API.
- [x] Convert all `dark:` utilities in touched files to `@dark:`.
- [x] Run `vitest` + Playwright visual tests.
- [x] **Eliminate `getPanelClasses`**
   - [x] Replace each call with `panel.variants` helpers or direct Tailwind classes.
   - [x] Update associated unit tests and snapshots.
- [x] **Validation & commit:** ensure lint/type/test pass after each migrated file set; commit frequently.

   - [x] Add field variants to `shared/index.ts` exports
- [ ] **Outstanding migrations:**
   - [ ] Migrate `app/routes/teams/teams.$teamId.tsx` to use new Panel component (currently uses legacy panel variants)
- [ ] **Delete legacy files:**
   - [x] `app/components/PanelOld.tsx`
   - [ ] `app/components/shared/panel.variants.ts` _(blocked by `app/routes/teams/teams.$teamId.tsx` - requires Panel migration)_
   - [ ] `app/styles/panel.styles.ts` (removes `getPanelClasses` and legacy helpers)

   - [x] Update remaining direct `PanelOld` references
- [ ] **Clean up variant files:** Remove any duplicate or unused panel variant definitions

### 6.7 Final Cleanup

- [ ] **Validation & commit:** final green run of lint, typecheck, tests before deleting legacy files; open PR-2.

- [ ] **Documentation update:** Update any component documentation to reflect new Panel API
- [ ] **Performance audit:** Ensure no CSS duplication or unused styles remain

---

## Phase 7‚ÄÇ¬∑‚ÄÇGuardrails

- [ ] Add ESLint / CI check to reject `dark:` classes (that aren‚Äôt `@dark:`) in any `*.tsx` under `app/components/`.
   ```bash
   grep -R "getPanelClasses" app/components && exit 1
   ```
- [ ] **Validation & commit:** CI must fail if rule violated; merge guardrail enforcement PR.
